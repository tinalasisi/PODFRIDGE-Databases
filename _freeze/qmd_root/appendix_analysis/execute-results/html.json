Donadio\"\ndate: today\nformat:\n  html:\n    toc: true\n    toc-depth: 3\n---\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nThis document provides complete transparency regarding the data sources and methodology used to compile racial disparities in DNA collection across U.S. states. The original data was collected in Summer 2017, with most data points from 2013-2016.\n\n### Key Findings\n\n-   **Consistent racial disparities**: Black populations show the highest DNA collection rates relative to their population percentage in nearly all states\n\n-   **Data limitations**: Many states lack comprehensive conviction data, requiring the use of prison admission proxies\n\n-   **Methodological challenges**: Hispanic/Latino populations often uncounted or miscategorized in state data\n\n## Methodology Overview\n\n### Data Collection Period\n\n-   Primary collection: Summer 2017\n\n-   Data years used: Single year per state (2012-2016, varies by availability)\n\n-   Census baseline: 2010 U.S. Census for demographic comparisons\n\n### General Challenges Encountered\n\n1.   **Conviction Data Scarcity**: Most states do not publicly disclose comprehensive felony conviction data\n\n2.   **Prison Admission Proxy**: Prison admissions used as substitute for conviction data in majority of states\n\n3.   **Racial Classification Inconsistencies**:\n\n    -   Many states only report \"Black\" and \"White\" categories\n\n    -   Hispanic/Latino often classified as ethnicity rather than race\n\n    -   \"Other\" category frequently used without specification\n\n4.   **Arrest Data Gaps**: Racial makeup of arrests often unavailable or incomplete\n\n## National Summary Table\n\n### Methodology: Parsing DNA Collection Data\n\nThe national summary data was extracted from a structured text file (`MurphyTong_Racial_Breakdown.txt`) containing three distinct data sections for each state:\n\n1. **DNA Collection Data**: Percentage and absolute counts of DNA profiles collected by race (e.g., \"46% B (18,253)\")\n2. **Population Demographics**: Percentage of state population by race from 2010 Census\n\n**Processing Steps**:\n\n- **State Identification**: The parser identifies state entries using standard two-letter abbreviations (AL, AK, AZ, etc.)\n- **Section Segmentation**: For each state, the text is divided into three sections based on the pattern of \"% B\" (Black percentage) occurrences\n- **Data Extraction**: Regular expressions extract both percentages and counts from the first section, and percentages only from the demographic and rate sections\n- **Pattern Matching**: The code uses regex patterns like `([0-9.]+)%\\s*B\\s*\\(([0-9,]+)\\)` to capture both percentage (e.g., 46%) and count (e.g., 18,253) for DNA collection data\n- **Race Categories**: Data is extracted for five racial categories: Black (B), Hispanic (H), Asian (A), Native American (N), and White (W)\n\nThis automated parsing ensures reproducibility and allows for systematic extraction of data from the original Murphy & Tong study format.\n\n\n::: {#tbl-national-summary .cell tbl-cap='Racial Breakdown of Annual DNA Collection for Each State'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show summary code\"}\n#

Methodology: Parsing State Methodology Paragraphs\n\nThe detailed methodology for each state was extracted from a separate text file (`MurphyTong_States_Paragraphs.txt`) containing narrative descriptions of data collection approaches for all 50 states. This section explains how we systematically parsed this unstructured text into a structured dataset.\n\n**Processing Steps**:\n\n1. **State Detection**: The parser identifies state entries by searching for the 50 U.S. state names as they appear in the text\n2. **Section Extraction**: For each state, the parser captures all text from the state name until the next state name appears\n3. **Component Parsing**: Within each state's section, the code extracts four key components:\n   - **Legal Framework**: The statutory basis for DNA collection in that state\n   - **Collection Triggers**: Specific offenses or events that trigger DNA collection\n   - **Data Sources**: Types of data used (e.g., conviction records, prison admissions, arrest data)\n   - **Source URLs**: Web links to the original data sources\n   - **Data Limitations**: Known gaps, proxies, or methodological caveats\n\n4. **Structured Data Creation**: Each data source line is parsed into a type-note pair (e.g., \"Prison admissions: Used as proxy for conviction data\")\n\n5. **Categorization**: The parser automatically categorizes:\n   - **Collection trigger types**: Comprehensive, selective, felony-only, etc.\n   - **Data limitation types**: Missing conviction data, ethnicity issues, limited racial categories, etc.\n   - **Data source types**: Conviction data, arrest data, prison data, sex crime data, etc.\n\nThis systematic extraction allows for consistent comparison across states and identification of common patterns in data collection methodologies and limitations.\n\n\n:::

This integration allows researchers to understand both the magnitude of DNA collection and the quality/limitations of the underlying data sources.\n\n**Integration Process**:\n\n1. **Primary Dataset**: The `summary_data` table contains all quantitative metrics:\n   - DNA collection counts and percentages by race\n   - State population demographics by race\n   - Collection rates per 100,000 population by race\n\n2. **Study Methodology Addition**: The `methodology_summary` table provides contextual information:\n   - Legal framework for DNA collection\n   - Specific collection triggers\n   - Data source types and limitations\n   - Source URLs for verification\n\n3. **Joining Strategy**: \n   - States are matched using full state names\n   - A crosswalk table converts two-letter abbreviations to full names\n   - Left join ensures all states from the summary data are retained\n\n4. **Column Selection**: The final dataset includes:\n   - **State identifier**: Full state name\n   - **Collection metrics**: All DNA collection counts, percentages, and rates by race\n   - **Methodology context**: Legal framework, collection triggers, data limitations\n   - **Quality flags**: Categorized data limitation types for filtering/analysis\n\n5. **Output Format**: One row per state with 30+ columns covering demographics, collection rates, and methodology\n\nThis unified structure enables analyses that account for data quality differences across states when interpreting racial disparities in DNA collection.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"
